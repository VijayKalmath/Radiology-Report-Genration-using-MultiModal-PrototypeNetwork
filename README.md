### Radiology-Report-Genration-using-MultiModal-PrototypeNetwork

Radiology report generation (RRG) aims to describe automatically a radiology image with human-like language and could potentially support the work of radiologists, reducing the burden of manual reporting.

In this project , we analyze the Radiology Report Datasets namely IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR and build models to improve current State of the Art.
